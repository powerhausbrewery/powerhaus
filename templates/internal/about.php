            <h4>How shit happen</h4><br>
            <p>Paul Hawley and Remy Martin both grew up in Sonoma County where the redwoods meet the vineyards. They
                have over thirty years of combined experience in the wine industry. The old saying, "it takes a lot
                of
                beer to make wine" rings especially true for these long-time friends who have been brewing together
                since 2004, when they worked the grape harvest in New Zealand. Remy went on to study brewing at UC
                Davis
                and has experience working at a number of local breweries. Paul has been working at his family's
                winery
                in Dry Creek Valley since 2005</p>
